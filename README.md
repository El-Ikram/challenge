# GNNs Mini Competition: GitHub Social Network Classification
<p align="center">What if we could predict user characteristics just by looking at how they connect with others?</p>

## 💢Problem Description
The goal of this challenge is to perform binary node classification on a real-world GitHub social network graph. In this graph, each node represents a GitHub user, and edges represent social connections between users.

Your task is to build a model that leverages both node features and graph structure to predict whether a given GitHub user is primarily a Web Developer or a Machine Learning Developer.

Task Type:
* Node Classification
* Binary Classification
* Graph-Based Learning with GNNs
* Each node = one label:\
 1 → Web Developer.\
 0 → Machine Learning Developer.

## 🛢️Dataset
The GitHub Social Network dataset represents a real-world developer network where nodes correspond to GitHub users and edges represent social connections between them (such as following relationships). Each user is associated with feature information derived from their public activity, repositories, or profile characteristics.

The dataset contains:
* musae_git_edges.csv → Graph edges (source, target).

* musae_git_features.json → Node feature vectors.

* train_target.csv → Training labels.

* test_target.csv → Test nodes (labels hidden).

Graph Statistics:
* Nodes: ~37K.
* Edges: ~289K.
* Features: 128-dimensional node features.
* Task: Binary classification.

The dataset is split as follows:
| Split    | Percentage | Description                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Training | 70%        | Features + labels             |
| Testing  | 30%        | Features only (labels hidden) |

The test labels are stored in a private evaluation repository and are not accessible to participants to ensure fair ranking.

The competition dataset represents a graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸) where: 𝑉 = nodes and 𝐸 = edges.

🧩 Graph Components:
* Adjacency Matrix:
File: [adjacency_matrix.npz](data/public/adjacency_matrix.npz)

Shape: (N, N)

Type: Sparse matrix

The adjacency matrix 𝐴 represents connections between nodes.
If node i is connected to node j, then: 𝐴ᵢⱼ = 1 Otherwise: 𝐴ᵢⱼ = 0

* Node Feature Matrix
File: [node_features.npz](data/public/node_features.npy)

Shape: (N, F)

Each row corresponds to one node.
Each column represents a feature.

$X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F}$


Where:
𝑁 = number of nodes and 𝐹 = number of features.

The GitHub Social Network dataset used in this challenge is publicly available through the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP).

The challenge is evaluated using **Macro F1-score**.

The F1-score is defined as:

F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Where:

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)  
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

For binary classification, we compute the F1-score independently for each class and then average them:

Macro F1 = (F1_class_0 + F1_class_1) / 2

### Why Macro F1?

- Ensures balanced performance across classes  
- Prevents majority-class bias  
- Standard metric in graph node classification research  

Submissions will be ranked by **Macro F1-score on the hidden test set**. Higher Macro F1 values indicate better overall classification quality across all classes.

## ⚠️Constraints
To ensure fair competition:
1. No External Data, only the data provided for this challenge may be used.
2. No external node features, it must be derived solely from the given dataset.
3. No pretrained embeddings or models, all models must be trained from scratch using the provided data.
4. Keep your model simple and interpretable (deeper is not always better).
   
Think of this as a “from-scratch GNN challenge”, no shortcuts, no pretrained magic, just pure graph learning✨

## 📤Submission
Ready to compete? Follow these steps to get your model on the leaderboard 
* Each participant needs to fork this repository to his GitHub account.
* Each participant needs to use the provided starter code as a baseline and implement your GNN model (while respecting all constraints!).
* Each participant after generating predictions for the test set needs to save them as a CSV file with the required format:\
   id , name , ml_target .
* Ensure:
    The file contains predictions for all test nodes.\
    The order of IDs matches test_nodes.csv.\
    The file name is your_team_name_submission.csv
* Place your submission.csv file inside the submissions/ folder and create a Pull Request.
* Once your Pull Request is opened:\
    Your submission will be automatically evaluated.\
    The score will be computed using the hidden test labels.\
    Your result will be added to the leaderboard.

 🌟Higher scores climb higher🌟
  
## 🏆Leaderboard
The competition features a **dynamic, automatically updated leaderboard**.
